Migrating from JBehave to Cucumber , we need to convert all our .jbehave extension files to .feature(gherkin) files.

there are some syntactical differences in the content of the file , so all that needs to be taken care using
some rules found out by analysing the differences across the two files.

Example :

1. If anything in jbehave ends with a colon , remove that line
2. MOre rule
3. Even more rules...


JBehave Stories lie under a parent folder (resorces > stories) ,and grouped by squads

resources
    stories
        team1
          story1.story
          story2.story
          story3.story
        team2
          story4.story
          story5.story
        team3
          story6.story
          story7.story


          and so on.....
